## Notes

This inlcudes documentation during development

### Method 1

we are using a Neural Network to solve the classification problem, we have a ImageClassifier with multiple layers that uses a ReLU, it then gets trained with our train data and creates a model,
this model can then be loaded and given an image.jpg and it outputs the give class
