# signLangML

## The implementation process is documented in the notes.md where we describe our approach and problems faced.

Instructions:
The Sign Language Dataset consists of 9680 grayscale images of hand signs for the digits 0-9 and the alphabets a-z. Thus, this is a multiclass classification problem with 36 classes. Your task is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify images from this dataset. Detailed description of evaluation and report are in the project-instructions.pdf, here is a short summary of the content. Decide what the problem is about, what methods should be applied, try different methods, understand the method you use, be able to explain how it works, and most importantly explain what you used. Focus more on finding a good model and following a principled way of achieving this.
