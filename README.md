# signLangML
The Sign Language Dataset consists of 9680 grayscale images of hand signs for the digits 0-9 and the alphabets a-z. Thus, this is a multiclass classification problem with 36 classes. Your task is to build a machine learning model that can accurately classify images from this dataset.

The implementation process is documented in the notes.md where we describe our approach and problems faced.

detailed description of evaluation and report are in the project-instructions.pdf, here is a short summary of the content

The report template contains questions. Your report must answer those questions because we grade your answers in the report. The report must be two pages (three pages for the 3 person team) in length, see the report-template for details

Decide what the problem is about, what methods should be applied, try different methods, understand the method you use, be able to explain how it works, and most importantly explain what you used

focus more on finding a good model and following a principled way of achieving this
max size of file is 50mb for the module

a.) provide a version of your model that runs on the jupyterhub to evaluate the test dataset

b.) provide a runnable version of your training scripts as a zipfile on OLAT.
